In this assignment, you will begin to create your own formal website plan by defining the website’s goals and objectives, writing a formal purpose statement, and creating a target audience profile and needs assessment. You will also plan its general content and structure.
Using the assignment 2 as your starting point, create a formal website plan.
1. Determine your website’s goals and objectives and draft the website’s purpose statement.
2. Identify your website’s target audience(s) and determine the wants, needs, and likely expectations that your website’s design and content should satisfy for that audience.
3. Identify the pages you initially plan to include at your website.
4. Add to your website plan a list of value-added content that will help achieve your website’s purpose and satisfy target audience needs. Identify possible sources for the content, keeping in mind the copyright issues.
5. Determine which of the three website structures—linear/tutorial, webbed, or hierarchical (or a combination of structures)—will best meet your website’s purpose. Use a text outline, manually draw the structure, or use software to illustrate your website’s structure as part of your design plan.
6. Remember to compress your folder assignment with all the documents and upload it to Blackboard.
