<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">An Extended Definition of Synthesizers </h1>
        <p style="background-color:grey;"><br>A synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates sound that can be manipulated using various methods of producing and merging frequencies.
        The capabilities of synthesizers are far beyond the scope and flexibility of the sounds traditional analog instruments can generate. An elaborate design of wires,
        integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors, etc. are the elements of signal processing for these machines. Developing the frequency, velocity, amplification,
        duration and timbre is entirely up to the imagination and knowledge of an individual using the device.<br>
